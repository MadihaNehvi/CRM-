- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships in the dataset.
- Customer-Centric Feature Engineering: Creating metrics like Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis: Segmentation of customers based on their transaction behavior.
- Machine Learning (Clustering): Using algorithms to group customers into distinct segments.

## Questions Answered:
1. What are the key characteristics of customer purchasing behavior?
2. How can customers be effectively segmented for targeted marketing?
3. What insights can be derived from Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics?
